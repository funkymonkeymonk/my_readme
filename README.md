# Welcome

Intentions
* Transparency
* API Interface
* Expectations
* Empowerment to change
* Interaction

## Description
* I am currently Engineering Manager at Meetup
  - [Description] (https://github.com/meetup/engineering-roles/blob/master/managers/engineering.md)
* I'm also an Engineering Lead in the Core Services business unit

## Design Philosophy

### Servent Leadership

## Blameless

## Feedback
* I like feedback, in both directions
* However these are important:
	* Safety - it is unlikely that anything negative will occur for giving feedback
	* Effort - the feedback process should not result in arguing, but in honest open discussion
	* Benefit - feedback should have an outcome, something that will result in change

## One-on-One Meetings
* These meetings are important
* They do not have to be status updates, they can be what you want them to be
* I will most likely have some topics to discuss as well
* They do not need to be in a meeting room
	* Walking, Coffee, Lunch etc...


## Direct Responsibility Individual
  * I believe strongly in this principle
  * Everything should have a single owner who is responsible
  * If you are responsible for something and are not going to be available, it is your responsibility to make sure someone is responsible for you
  	* If you have an emergency never worry, I've got you covered, always

## More Working Code Principle
* We do stuff that gets used (has a job, is working)
* We do stuff that works (it works)
* We do stuff that provides a benefit (it's working for us, it provides measurable value, or informs us to why it's not)

## Make mistakes. Learn From Them. Share That Knowledge


## WPI (Will Personal Interface) Documentation
### My Availability
* If it's free on my calendar, it's yours to book
* I prefer you just book it than message me to ask if you can book the time
  - If I need to decline, I'll decline in calendar
  - Or just grab me if it's urgent
* If you need me and can't find me:
	- Slack Me
	- Text/Call Me
	- For critical production issues reach out to the oncall person
* If you report to me, directly or not, and can't find time with me on my calendar slack me and we'll work something out

## Me
* I care about you
* I care about results
* I don't believe in blockers
* I believe in small things that make big things
* I believe in daily goal setting
* I believe in the honesty and focus of seeing what we are doing routinely
* I like to be on time, though not always possible
* I only believe in two priorities
	* High - What I need to do right now
	* What I might do next
* I will never lie to you, however I may defer the truth because of legal or privacy reasons

## Work Hours
* Follow company guidelines, but also:
* Get stuff done, deliver on our goals
* Be there when your team needs you
* I may message you at anytime, you are not expected to respond except within normal working hours, unless;
	* You are on call, and I indicate there is need to

## How are you doing
* You will know
* However I think there are three stages
	* You are meeting your current goals
	* You are struggling to meet your goals
	* You are underwater and are in trouble, and we need to have a serious conversation, but this should never be a surprise
	* NOTE: I did not list exceeding current goals because if you are, I think we should applaud that, celebrate it and reset your goals
	* NOTE 2: Goals also include improving or growing yourself and career

## What (I think) I'm Good At
* Focusing on the next right/best thing
* Big picture
* Dismantling blockers
* Listening
* Making Decisions
* Helping you make decisions

Matt, as your manager
I’m excited to get to know you more organically through chats, but a few up-front things about my philosophies that might be helpful.

I’m here to help and support you, to set context for what you’re working on, and to advocate for you and the team with the rest of the company.
—-

My availability looks scary, but I’m here for you!
My calendar is full of meetings and it may be intimidating to schedule something with me. If you see a good time on my calendar, please schedule something (you don’t need to ask first). I’ll be there (my Google Calendar is 99.9% accurate excluding ad-hoc meetings). If there’s urgency and you can’t get a meeting with me for a while, send me a message on Slack or text and I’ll make time. If you need to reschedule something, that is not a problem! I endeavor to make all of my calendar events with modify privileges (I use this extension) and you should feel free to go ahead and move it to some other time slot that’s within business hours and not conflicting with other meetings.

I think highly of the DRI model.
To clarify: you’re here because of your experience and your skills and I don’t want to override either of those. I’m here to help you succeed but not dictate how you should act.
If I think you’re headed down the wrong path, I’ll definitely try to dissuade you, but disagreeing with my input does not indicate that you’re doing something wrong.
You’ll still need to get consensus, agreement, and input from your teammates.
Process and Software Development
I strongly believe in putting people over process and changing process to accommodate our needs and goals. I’ve worked with and without Agile, with and without a form of Scrum. At the end of the day, these are my values:

I value transparency about what’s happened, what’s happening, and what’s going to happen.
I value speed, including proactive efforts that keep us moving quickly (e.g. writing tests, refactoring legacy code before a new feature, pairing on work to improve our code quality and bus factor)
I value learning, and know that training up on a tech stack may not always be the fastest route to production.
I value your time and don’t want you to do any process that is neither beneficial to you nor required by law, policy, etc.
Feedback is very important to me.
In situations where anonymous feedback is suggested, you’ll probably hear me suggesting that you provide direct feedback, though anonymous feedback is better than none. I’m dedicated to giving you clear and timely feedback and hope that you’ll give me the same. I believe that feedback requires three attributes:

Safety (you should feel safe to give and receive candid feedback)
Effort (neither you nor I should feel defensive about the feedback)
Benefit (giving/receiving feedback should have impact)
Please let me know if I’m doing poorly on any of these attributes. I’ll return the favor!

I’m big on work/life balance.
Most folks work between about 8am (at the earliest) to 6pm (at the latest), and unless there’s an emergency, I don’t expect to communicate with you outside of these hours with respect to your local time. I try not to respond to e-mails or slack during off-hours and under no circumstances expect you to, unless it’s an emergency.

One on one meetings
I’m big on 1:1s. I believe that these meetings are for you to set the agenda. What would you like to talk about? What’s going well? What’s bugging you? These don’t need to be status updates unless you really want to talk about project status. For local chats, I really enjoy walking 1:1s; for remote chats, I have a difficult time focusing unless I can see your face over video. If there are things that I want to ask you, I’ll do it, but this is your time. The length, frequency, and medium are also up to you, but my hope is that we’ll have at least 30 minutes a week, with an optimal 60 minutes per week. This is only a minimum though, and not a maximum! I prefer to have separate meetings scheduled for agenda-driven chats (e.g. goals, reviewing 360 feedback, etc.) so that we still have room for more timely 1:1 chat.

Relationships
I endeavor to have a great working relationship with you, and I would encourage you to have great working relationships with your peers and business partners (in the office and/or on your team), as well as other folks in other offices to get a sense of how things work outside of our team. I’m happy to make introductions for you or provide networking suggestions to help you do that.

Week in Review
I started writing a Week in Review² blog (though my updates are super infrequent). I think of it as an annotated version of some topics that may come up in our 1:1s. Please consider this a living document to comment in, ask questions about, etc.

Your Philosophies
I’ve written a lot here about my philosophies but a fair amount of my job is adapting to your needs and philosophies, and I look forward to talking to you about them!

Footnotes
¹ It’s a pretty great place to learn things, network, and find a lot of kind and differing views on leadership and management. Check it out.

² I learned this trick from Lara Hogan who referenced where she learned it, along with an example post here. In the version I share internally, I’d link the WIR there.
