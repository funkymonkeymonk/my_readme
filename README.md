* Interaction

## Features
* Engineering Manager at Meetup
  - [Description] (https://github.com/meetup/engineering-roles/blob/master/managers/engineering.md)
* Engineering Lead for Core Services
*

## Design Philosophy

### People First

### Servent Leadership

### Blameless

### Feedback
* I like feedback, in both directions
* However these are important:
	* Safety - it is unlikely that anything negative will occur for giving feedback
	* Effort - the feedback process should not result in arguing, but in honest open discussion
	* Benefit - feedback should have an outcome, something that will result in change

### One-on-One Meetings
* These meetings are important
* They do not have to be status updates, they can be what you want them to be
* I will most likely have some topics to discuss as well
* They do not need to be in a meeting room
	* Walking, Coffee, Lunch etc...

### Direct Responsibility Individual
  * I believe strongly in this principle
  * Everything should have a single owner who is responsible
  * If you are responsible for something and are not going to be available, it is your responsibility to make sure someone is responsible for you
  	* If you have an emergency never worry, I've got you covered, always

### More Working Code Principle
* We do stuff that gets used (has a job, is working)
* We do stuff that works (it works)
* We do stuff that provides a benefit (it's working for us, it provides measurable value, or informs us to why it's not)

### Make mistakes. Learn From Them. Share That Knowledge

## WPI (Will Personal Interface) Reference
### My Availability
* If it's free on my calendar, it's yours to book
* I prefer you just book it than message me to ask if you can book the time
  - If I need to decline, I'll decline in calendar
  - Or just grab me if it's urgent
* If you need me and can't find me:
	- Slack Me
	- Text/Call Me
	- For critical production issues reach out to the oncall person
* If you report to me, directly or not, and can't find time with me on my calendar slack me and we'll work something out

## How To Use
